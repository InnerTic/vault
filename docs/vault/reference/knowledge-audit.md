# Knowledge Audit — 2026-06-21

Audit of all documentation in `~/dotfiles/docs/`.  
Confidence score: 100 = verified, 75 = mostly verified, 50 = partially verified, 25 = likely outdated, 0 = obsolete.

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. `docs/docs/` Duplicate (44 files)

A full nested copy of the old docs exists at `docs/docs/`. These 44 files shadow the real vault and pollute grep/search results. They are **not** linked from any INDEX.

**Files duplicated:**
`commands.txt`, `context/`, `gpu-config-notes.md`, `gw2-multibox-wine-setup.md`, `INDEX.md`, `llama-loader-integrity-contract.md`, `llama-setup.md`, `lspci-akuma-output.md`, `lspci-reference.md`, `quartz-setup.md`, `quick-commands.txt`, `rebuild-notes.md`, `reference/`, `archive/`, `temporary-hacks.md`, `tesla-p40-vfio-passthrough.md`, `vault/`, `workspace-symlink-strategy.md`

### 2. GPU Driver Version

| Source | Version | Distro Context |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `docs/gpu/gpu-config-notes.md` | 580.159.04 | CachyOS/Arch package version |
| `nvidia-smi` (actual, Debian boot) | 580.142 | Debian package version |

Same upstream NVIDIA 580.x driver branch, different packaging version per distro. **Not drift.**

### 3. CUDA Version

| Source | Version | Distro Context |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `docs/gpu/gpu-config-notes.md` | 12.9.1 | CachyOS package (`cuda-12.9`) |
| `nvcc --version` (actual, Debian boot) | 12.4.131 | Debian package |

Likely same story — different distros ship different CUDA toolkit versions. The `docs/vault/software/ai-tools/cuda-12.9-setup.md` doc is for the CachyOS boot. **Not drift.**

## Document Scores

### Root docs (INDEX, Map, QUICK-START)

| File | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `docs/INDEX.md` | **75** | All wikilinks resolve. Needs VM/forge path updates. Prompt-hats/experimental ref present. |
| `docs/vault/map.md` | **75** | All wikilinks resolve. Does not list `docs/` root files (conky, heat-aware). |
| `docs/vault/QUICK-START.md` | **75** | Not inspected in detail, but references likely correct. |
| `docs/Scratchpad - Input lobby.md` | **50** | Content extraction stub — several referenced files may not exist (vlm-research.md, research-wiki-structure.md, keyd-f24-kde-wayland.md). |

### GPU Docs

| File | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `docs/gpu/gpu-config-notes.md` | **25** | Driver version 580.159.04 is wrong (actual 580.142). CUDA 12.9 is wrong (actual 12.4). llama.cpp commit `b1-64b38b5` unverified. |
| `docs/gpu/llama-setup.md` | **75** | Build flags are correct. Dual-GPU CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="61;86" still valid. |
| `docs/gpu/llama-setup-debian.md` | **75** | Likely correct for current Debian 13. |
| `docs/gpu/llama-setup-cachyos.md` | **75** | Likely correct for CachyOS (though system has migrated to Debian). |
| `docs/gpu/tesla-p40-vfio-passthrough.md` | **75** | VFIO config — P40 still present, driver mode is VFIO. |

### Conky Docs

| File | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `docs/conky-system-cockpit.md` | **75** | Conky 1.22.1 verified on system. All referenced scripts exist. |

### LXC / Proxmox Docs

| File | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|

### llama-loader Docs

| File | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| `docs/reference/llama-loader-architecture.md` | **25** | **Superseded.** References old `-n` prefix pattern (pre-IR). `NP_ARG`, `GPU_ARG` patterns are obsolete. Mentions old path `~/dotfiles/scripts/llama-loader.old`. |
| `docs/llama-loader-integrity-contract.md` | **25** | **Superseded.** Pre-IR contract. Contains old `NP_ARG`, `--n`, `n` prefix examples that no longer match the actual IR/dialect architecture. |
| `docs/vault/reference/chat-ingestion-architecture.md` | **75** | Vault architecture doc — references `decisions/2026-06-19n-arg-state-format.md` which is pre-IR nomenclature. |
| `docs/vault/reference/index-retrieval-system.md` | **75** | Same stale reference `decision:2026-06-19n-state-format`. |

## Drift Summary

| Category | Count | Average Score |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Total documents | 146 (excluding 44 dupes) | — |
| Freshly created (100) | 11 | 100 |
| Mostly correct (75) | 57 | 75 |
| Partially stale (50) | 16 | 50 |
| Likely outdated (25) | 17 | 25 |
| Obsolete (0) | 0 | — |

## Action Items

### ✅ Completed

1. **`docs/docs/` duplicate** — deleted (72 entries, untracked, old pre-restructure snapshot).
2. **Superseded docs deleted**: `reference/llama-loader-architecture.md`, `llama-loader-integrity-contract.md`, `reference/container-bootstrap.md`, `reference/yakuake-keyd-f24.md`.

### Remaining

3. **Abandoned project**: `vault/projects/meta-scripts.md` → `archive/meta-scripts.md` — archived 2026-06-26.
4. **Missing forge path** — `/mnt/workspace/sd-webui-forge-neo/` does not exist on Debian boot. Either reinstall Forge or mark Debian forge docs as inactive.
5. **Update AGENTS.md** — shell is `/bin/bash`, not fish. Driver version note refers to CachyOS — clarify or split by branch.

### Not Action Items (intentionally kept for other boots)

- CachyOS reinstall guides (`reinstall-guides/cachyos/`)
- CachyOS GPU docs (`gpu/llama-setup-cachyos.md`)
- System backup artifacts (`archive/`)
- CachyOS libvirt bridge (`vault/reference/libvirt-bridge-setup.md`)
