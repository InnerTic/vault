- Character is possibly jealous

## Current Model

`gemma-4-26B-A4B-APEX-Compact.gguf` — 14G (MoE 4/26 experts, ~7B active)

**Path:** `/mnt/data/model_storage/gemma-4-26B-A4B-APEX-Compact.gguf`

**Research wiki:** [`gemma-4-26B-APEX-Compact` →](../../../../../../ai-model-research/individual-models/gemma-4-26b-apex-compact.md)

Shares the same model as Glossary Candidate (step 1) on a different port.

**Why this model:**
- **Same as glossary** — keeps disk footprint small
- **Structured diff output** — compact instruct variant follows formatting well

> **VRAM note:** 14G MoE model runs on P40 (24GB). Does not fit RTX 3060.

## Alternatives

Same as [[01-glossary-updater#Alternatives]].

| `gemma-4-26B-A4B-heretic-APEX-I-Quality.gguf` | 20G  | MoE ~7B   | Same MoE, larger file. No upside.                                                             |
